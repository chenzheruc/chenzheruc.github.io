Similarly, spreadsheets have <b>truncated data</b> when the data rows are truncated into multiple rows. <br>
For example, in the figure below, row 6-8 are headers, but headers, such as "RC 800" and "MC 30", are split into multiple rows. <br>
row 9-13 are one data tuple, but the address such as "1000 MacHenry St. EJ Dorudo, AR 71730" is split into multiple rows.
