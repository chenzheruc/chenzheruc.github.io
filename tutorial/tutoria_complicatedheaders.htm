<h2>Spreadsheet Complicated Hierarchical Header</h2>

Spreadsheets have <b>complicated hierarchical header</b> when its header regions should be explained with information outside the spreadsheet table. <br>
For example, in the figure below, row 8-9, 17-18, and 25-26 are all header rows, but those headers should be explained by the year information mentioned in row 5-6.
