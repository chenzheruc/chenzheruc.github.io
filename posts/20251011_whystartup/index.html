Need a massively scalable database, a world-class deployment system, or a complex data analysis tool? There’s likely an internal API for that, polished and ready to go. Plus the people around are all filtered by the extermely rigurous interview process. But what happens when you decide to peek over the wall, to see what life is like on the outside with the dream of building something of your own?\nI recently had a conversation with my friend Jing Conan Wang, a fellow ex-Googler who made the leap, and his insights were too valuable not to share.\nThe Shock of the “Messy” Outside World The first reality check is the tech stack. Inside Google, we’re accustomed to a world where countless problems have already been solved. The infrastructure is so robust and abstracted that we can often take it for granted.\nOutside, the landscape is entirely different. The world runs on a vibrant, powerful, and often “messy” ecosystem of open-source technologies. While this provides incredible flexibility, it comes with a steep learning curve. You’re no longer just an API consumer; you’re the architect, the builder, and the troubleshooter, piecing together disparate tools to create a cohesive system. This transition from Google’s curated garden to the open-source wilderness is a significant hurdle and requires patience and a willingness to learn an entirely new way of building.\nIt Can’t Be About the Money “If your goal is just to make money, it is much easier just to work for Google.”\nThis was one of Jing’s most potent points. The financial security of a Google career is hard to beat. The path of a startup founder is, by contrast, fraught with financial uncertainty. The odds are long, and the stress is high. Therefore, your motivation must be rooted in something deeper—a passion for the problem you’re solving, a desire to build something from scratch, or an unwavering belief in your vision. Without that intrinsic drive, the inevitable hardships will be difficult to endure.\nThe Decompression Period: A 2-3 Year Journey Leaving Google isn’t just a career change; it’s a paradigm shift. Jing mentioned that it typically takes about two to three years for someone to fully transition from the Google mindset and be truly ready to build a successful startup.\nHis personal experience offers a practical roadmap. After leaving Google, he didn’t immediately start his own company. Instead, he joined a very small startup and witnessed its growth from 10 to 100 people. He described this experience as invaluable, as it taught him firsthand the chaotic, fast-paced, and resource-constrained reality of a growing company. It was a masterclass in startup dynamics that he couldn’t have gotten anywhere else. If possible, he strongly recommends this “apprenticeship” phase to any aspiring founder.\nThe Four Pillars of a Successful Startup When it comes to building your company, Jing emphasized four critical elements, in order of importance:\nPeople: This is, without a doubt, the most crucial factor. Finding a co-founder is less like hiring a colleague and more like, in his words, a “marriage at work.” The relationship will be tested by stress, long hours, and difficult decisions. The ideal scenario is to partner with someone you’ve worked with before, someone with whom you’ve already navigated hard times. That shared history builds a foundation of trust that is nearly impossible to replicate.\nVision: Your vision is the North Star for your company. It’s more than just a clever idea; it’s the compelling, long-term change you want to bring to the world. This vision will be the foundation of your product, your roadmap, and the story you tell to attract your team and your first investors. It needs to be clear, ambitious, and something you are deeply passionate about.\nMoney: Fundraising is a well-documented gauntlet of frustration and rejection. Securing the capital to bring your idea to life is a challenging, often humbling, process that requires resilience and a compelling story.\nCulture: Don’t underestimate the power of your company’s initial culture. The decisions you make and the values you establish in the first six months will have an outsized impact, shaping the trajectory of your company for the next five to ten years.\nLeaving the comfort of the Google campus to build something new is a daunting prospect. It means trading a world of certainty and unparalleled resources for one of ambiguity and grit. But by understanding the challenges, finding the right motivation, and focusing on the foundational pillars, you can turn that peek over the wall into a successful journey into the real world.\n",
