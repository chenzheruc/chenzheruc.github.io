You start as an individual contributor, become a senior, then a manager, a director, and so on. Each rung promised more responsibility, a better title, and a bigger paycheck. This system, a relic of a bygone industrial era, was designed for a world of predictable growth and top-down management.\nBut that world is vanishing. Artificial intelligence is not just another tool; it’s a fundamental shift that will dismantle the very structure of the traditional corporate ladder. In the next 5-10 years, the way we think about career progression will be unrecognizable.\nThe Obsolescence of the “People Manager” The corporate ladder of the past was built on the need for middle management to organize labor, delegate tasks, track progress, and report up the chain. AI is poised to automate or augment many of these functions with terrifying efficiency. Project management, resource allocation, performance metric tracking, and even initial drafts of performance reviews can be handled by sophisticated AI systems.\nAs a result, companies will fundamentally change their hiring priorities. It’s likely that in the near future, many companies will stop hiring traditional “people managers.” The focus will shift away from those who simply manage people to those who can lead with vision. The new premium will be on individuals who demonstrate exceptional execution, judgment, and influential leadership. These are deeply human skills that AI cannot replicate—the ability to make a critical decision with incomplete data, inspire a team around a difficult goal, and navigate complex interpersonal dynamics.\nDon’t Index on a System Built for Yesterday If you are building your career plan around the current corporate ladder, you are planning for a future that will not exist. Do not treat climbing the existing hierarchy as your ultimate goal. The obsession with managing more people or attaining the next title is a trap. That system was designed for the old days, and AI will change everything.\nIn this new era, your impact will be far more important than your title. The industry trend is more important than the ladder. Are you working on a technology that is growing or shrinking? Are you developing skills that will be amplified by AI or replaced by it? Your ability to create value, solve complex problems, and leverage AI to innovate will define your success, not your position on an outdated org chart.\nThe New Career Compass: Radical Self-Awareness Without a clear ladder to climb, how do you navigate your career? The new path requires a turn inward. It demands a level of honesty and self-reflection that was optional in the past.\nBe honest with yourself. So many people make career decisions based on a default path or what others deem prestigious. But a path that looks good on paper might not belong to you. This misalignment doesn’t just affect which company you join; it dictates your long-term growth, happiness, and exposure to risk. If you make the wrong assumptions about what drives you, you will artificially limit your options. Your actions ultimately reflect what you truly want, so pay attention.\nYou have to do it to learn it. In the age of AI, you can’t just read about new technology; you have to use it. Only by doing the work yourself—building with the tools, experimenting with the platforms, and integrating them into your workflow—will you learn the real deal. This hands-on experience is what separates those who are prepared for the future from those who will be left behind.\nIf you’re not learning, you’re stagnating. If you find yourself cruising in your role and not learning new things, consider it a warning sign. Comfort is the enemy of growth in a rapidly changing world. That feeling of ease is a signal that your skills might soon become outdated.\nChange is the Only Constant The most successful professionals have always understood that they must evolve. Especially in an early career, change is often passive—you’re moved to new projects or teams. But as you gain experience, that change must become active and deliberate. You have to reflect frequently and ask yourself: “Am I still learning? Are my skills still relevant? Is it time to step out of my comfort zone?”\nThe long-term goal is no longer about reaching the top of a pre-defined structure. It’s about finding a path that provides sustained satisfaction, growth, and happiness. This means letting go of the ladder and instead focusing on building a career that is resilient, impactful, and, most importantly, authentically yours. The future doesn’t have a ladder; it has a landscape. It’s up to you to explore it.\nReference This blog is inspired by the meeting notes from Linghang mentorship.\n",
