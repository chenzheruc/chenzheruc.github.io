      <title>Andrew Ng&#39;s Agentic AI Playbook</title>
      <link>https://chenzheruc.github.io/posts/20251016_andrew_ng_agentic_ai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of AI is buzzing with a new paradigm: agentic AI. Instead of simply responding to a single prompt, these AI systems can reason, plan, use tools, and even critique their own work to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. They represent a significant leap from the non-agentic models we&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this technology matures, building effective and reliable agents has become a critical skill. AI luminary Andrew Ng, through his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/agentic-ai/&#34;&gt;Coursera courses&lt;/a&gt; published one week ago and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrRD7r7y7NY&#34;&gt;YouTube talks&lt;/a&gt;, has laid out a clear, practical framework for developing these intelligent systems. This playbook distills his key principles into actionable best practices for anyone looking to build the next generation of AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Corporate Ladder is Crumbling: How AI is Forcing a Rethink of Tech Careers</title>
      <link>https://chenzheruc.github.io/posts/20251015_corporate_ladder/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, the path to success in big tech, and corporate America at large, seemed straightforward: climb the ladder. You start as an individual contributor, become a senior, then a manager, a director, and so on. Each rung promised more responsibility, a better title, and a bigger paycheck. This system, a relic of a bygone industrial era, was designed for a world of predictable growth and top-down management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that world is vanishing. Artificial intelligence is not just another tool; it&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental shift that will dismantle the very structure of the traditional corporate ladder. In the next 5-10 years, the way we think about career progression will be unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Truman World to Real World: A Googler&#39;s Guide to StartUp </title>
      <link>https://chenzheruc.github.io/posts/20251011_whystartup/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The experience of working at Google is a bit like living in &amp;ldquo;Truman World.&amp;rdquo; We operate within a beautifully constructed world with arguably the planet&amp;rsquo;s best technical infrastructure. Need a massively scalable database, a world-class deployment system, or a complex data analysis tool? There&amp;rsquo;s likely an internal API for that, polished and ready to go. Plus the people around are all filtered by the extermely rigurous interview process. But what happens when you decide to peek over the wall, to see what life is like on the outside with the dream of building something of your own?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Idea to &#39;Vibe Code&#39;: Building a Kids&#39; Math App in a Few Hours</title>
      <link>https://chenzheruc.github.io/posts/20251008_vibe_coding/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was one of those evenings. An idea sparked, and I just had to run with it.
The concept was simple: a clean, fun, and straightforward web app for kids to practice basic
addition and subtraction. No frills, no complicated sign-ups, just pure, simple math.
I wanted to see if I could go from a thought to a functional product in just a few hours.
This is the story of that little coding sprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unseen Architects for Video Generation AI: Training Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the release of Sora 2 two days ago, Sam Altman has become widely recognized due to his frequent appearances in popular social media videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;In Shanghai&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;In Acient China&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;Talks to a random person&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://chenzheruc.github.io/pic/20251002/sam_altman_1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://chenzheruc.github.io/pic/20251002/sam_altman_2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://chenzheruc.github.io/pic/20251002/sam_altman_3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sora 2 are gaining popularity; however, detailed public documentation regarding their underlying training methodologies remains scarce. OpenAI simply noted that Sora takes inspiration from large language models (LLMs) that acquire generalist capabilities by training on &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/&#34;&gt;internet-scale data&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that OpenAI may have scraped YouTube content without permission from Google. On the other hand, Google’s Veo is assumed to benefit from YouTube&amp;rsquo;s high-quality video. The implication is clear: the ability to generate realistic video is directly proportional to access to petabytes of high-quality, varied footage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AGI is a Decade Away from Andrej Karpathy</title>
      <link>https://chenzheruc.github.io/posts/20251018_agi/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, Sam Altman published &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.samaltman.com/&#34;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; discussing &amp;ldquo;The Intelligence Age&amp;rdquo; and stated, &amp;ldquo;It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I&amp;rsquo;m confident we&amp;rsquo;ll get there&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the whirlwind of AI advancements, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to believe that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is just around the corner. Every week, a new model is released that shatters previous benchmarks, writes better code, or creates more realistic images. The hype cycle suggests we are on the precipice of a new dawn. Yet, one of the most respected minds in the field, Andrej Karpathy, recently poured a dose of realism on the fire, stating that  AGI is still &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUZvyajciY&#34;&gt;a decade away.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Roadblocks to AI Adoption: Key Challenges</title>
      <link>https://chenzheruc.github.io/posts/20251001_ai_system_challenges/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence systems are rapidly transforming the global economy, promising unprecedented efficiency, insight, and innovation. However, transitioning from AI&amp;rsquo;s theoretical potential to practical, ethical, and scalable application is fraught with significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethical-and-trust-concerns&#34;&gt;Ethical and Trust Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most public and critical challenges surrounding AI revolve around how these powerful systems interact with human values, fairness, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Black Box Problem (Lack of Explainability)&lt;/strong&gt;. The &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; nature of advanced AI, where decision-making logic is opaque to users and developers, creates the Explainable AI (XAI) crisis that prevents necessary auditing, justification, and trust in critical sectors like finance and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
