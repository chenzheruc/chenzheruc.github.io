It was one of those evenings. An idea sparked, and I just had to run with it. 
The concept was simple: a clean, fun, and straightforward web app for kids to practice basic 
addition and subtraction. No frills, no complicated sign-ups, just pure, simple math. 
I wanted to see if I could go from a thought to a functional product in just a few hours. 
This is the story of that little coding sprint. 


The website is already online at [MathWhiz](https://mathwhiz.edusparkai.online/). 
In the beginning I used Gemini Pro 2.5 in AI studio to make it happen. However, when things gets 
more and more complicated, I went ahead to integrate with VS Code to work on more complicated structures. 

"vibe code" is about perfect, scalable, enterprise-level architecture. 
With a few promts I am able to get a prototype working. However, AI is not perfect.
When I am trying to replace the SVG generated giraffs with a png image, it didn't work 
immediately. However, I ask Gemini to debug, but it kept doing stupid things by changing 
the directly of the image again and again and without resolving the real problem: it 
turns out the picture was broken somehow. At last, we spend time to manually carefully 
investigate and found the root cause. 

Let me know if you have any thoughts!
